# Reconciling Trade-offs in Photovoltaic Deployment on Abandoned Cropland for Accelerating Climate Goals in the United States 

Abstract: The rapid expansion of photovoltaic (PV) farms has intensified cross-sector land competition and amplified uncertainties in climate decision-making. Deploying PV on marginal land such as abandoned cropland offers a scalable and cost-effective alternative, yet its outcomes remain insufficiently understood. Here, we modularize machine learning and scenario analysis into a spatially explicit framework that integrates the environmental, emission, and economic (3E) dimensions. We find that deploying PV on 4.38 Mha of abandoned cropland in the United States could offset 104.99 Gt CO₂ (10.04 TWh yr⁻¹), equivalent to 21.0% of the 2050 global carbon neutrality target. However, while abandoned cropland shows high environmental similarity to existing PV farms, only 30.6% of sites are economically profitable, and large-scale deployment risks long-term financial losses of USD 459 billion from 2020-2050. Moreover, PV mitigation is 27-fold more effective than Land-based Natural Climate Solutions (LNCS), yet nearly half of potential sites overlap with high forest carbon sink regions. Our coupling coordination solution demonstrates that reducing 43.2% economic weight in decision-making could alleviate trade-offs, yielding an average 6.6 ± 1.2% improvement across the 3E dimensions. Ultimately, comprehensive climate policy is essential to reconcile endogenous trade-offs in PV deployment and accelerate U.S. progress toward net-zero goals.





# 1 Introduction

To cap cumulative carbon emissions at approximately 335 PgC from 2023 onward and meet global climate targets, the large scale deployment of low carbon photovoltaic (PV) systems is indispensable1,2. By 2050, solar PV will become the world’s leading electricity source with 8,519 GW of installed capacity, meeting 25% of total demand3,4. As the leading force in global energy industry and preeminent energy consumer, the United States (US) remains the largest historical carbon emitter, now pursues an ambitious transition by expanding its solar share to roughly 30 % by mid century5. However, the rapid rollout of PV in rural communities threatens productive cropland and impose adverse environmental impacts6. This tension has spurred growing interest in natural and land-based climate solutions, like allocating PV or afforestation on marginal lands, including open-pit mining sites7, and urban-rural settlements8. Despite numerous promising climate solutions, a cost-effective way of large-scale PV deployment at the national scale remains largely unknown, thereby clouding policymakers' confidence in advancing energy transitions. To fill this gap, we quantify both the land-based PV deployment potential from 2020-2050 and highlight potential decision-making trade-offs, including environmental suitability, emission abatement potential, and economic feasibility (3-E).

Solar energy is essential for climate mitigation; however, unlike nuclear, bioenergy, or geothermal energy, the power output of PV is highly sensitive to environmental conditions9. Recent research shows strong compatibility between cropland and PV deployment10, as farming activities already exist in regions with favorable solar radiation temperature, and wind conditions. While US croplands expand over 0.4 million hectares annually11, substantial abandonment also occurs in areas like the Mid-Atlantic Coast, aligning with the accelerating abandonment trends observed across the Global North12. Like agrivoltaics co-location and perovskite PV approaches, redeveloping abandoned cropland for PV installation represents a promising emissions reduction pathway that could provide unique spatial opportunities. However, large-scale PV deployment requires local energy infrastructure and socio-economic support, which vary significantly across regions. Previous research has inadequately captured these national-specific spatiotemporal heterogeneities. Recent advances in machine learning and high-dimensional statistical data embedding offer opportunities to extract multi-dimensional characteristics from historical PV installation data and generalize these insights to specific policy target regions.

Although Natural Climate Solutions (NCS) are widely recognized as the most cost-effective approach for carbon abatement13, ecosystems require decades for long-term carbon sequestration and have high land demand. Field experiments from the United States14, Israel15 etc., have demonstrated that despite PV deployment leading to a significantly decrease in surface albedo and consequently increase local temperature, the atmospheric carbon mitigation efficiency is ~50× than afforestation. Furthermore, as the US levelized cost of PV electricity generation continues to decline to $0.03 by 2030, large-scale PV deployment will become increasingly economically viable. However, current assessments of solar deployment potential remain limited in scope, primarily focusing on electricity generation potential while neglecting the broader economic feasibility and policy implications. The absence of comprehensive cross-sectoral comparative evaluations (e.g., agriculture, forestry, grass) may significantly underestimate the policy potential of large-scale PV deployment and create uncertainty for policymakers in advancing energy transitions.

Here, we propose an extensible decision-making framework for land-based climate policy. First, using time-series land-use imagery of ESA-CCI and PV farm locations from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and inventory dataset, we developed a two-stage machine learning model for integrating prior environmental predictors PV farms and generating negative labels. Second, we estimate the probability distribution of cropland redevelopment strategies based on statistical measurement principles, calculate the net emissions reduction expectations of land-based NCS, and further validate the emissions reduction potential of photovoltaics. Third, utilizing policy scenarios from the AR6 assessment, we estimate the net cash flows and cumulative cost changes of PV deployment compared to other emissions reduction strategies under different future climate policy scenarios from 2020 to 2050. Finally, we integrate these three dimensions to generate a PV deployment priority decision map (Fig.1), which could serve as a decision-making tool for US and other countries.

## 2.1 PV priorities on US abandoned cropland, and outcome trade-offs 
 

Fig.1 US abandoned cropland priorities for different PV deploying strategies and 3EF outcomes. a. abandoned cropland priorities. b-d, Outcomes for single objective of (b) Environmental sustainability (dimensionless), (c) carbon emission mitigation (Mg), and (d) economic revenue (USD in 2020).

Over the 28-year period following 1992, the continental US accumulated 4.38 Mha of stable abandoned cropland, maintaining an annual growth rate of 19.89%. This substantial land base provides significant marginal space for large-scale photovoltaic deployment. Consistent with earlier findings, these abandoned croplands are primarily concentrated in Texas, Illinois, and California, with the most rapid growth occurring in the Mid-Atlantic, Gulf Coast, and Pacific Northwest regions. Our PV deployment priorities provide a multi-objective policy pathway for supporting adaptive climate policy (Fig. 1), emphasizing the necessity of precision deployment over homogeneous deployment strategies. The outcomes of PV deployment on US abandoned cropland reveal considerable trade-offs and spatial heterogeneity, particularly when focusing exclusively on environmental sustainability, carbon mitigation potential, or economic revenue (see Methods). 

First, high environmental suitability scores indicate greater similarity between historical PV construction environments and abandoned cropland, with local infrastructure and geographic-climatic conditions better suited to the technical requirements of photovoltaic installation. However, PV deployment strategies based solely on environmental suitability objectives face substantial long-term economic losses for the same deployed area (with the maximum benefit gap occurring at the 45.5th percentile of priority areas, equivalent to requiring an additional 2.13-fold cost recovery). Therefore, even for pre-cultivated land with extremely high consistency with cropland conditions, large-scale PV deployment still requires consideration of real-world feasibility, particularly the economic dimension. 

Regarding carbon mitigation benefits, under theoretical conditions from 2020-2050, converting all abandoned cropland generated in the United States from 1992-2020 to photovoltaics could cumulatively substitute grid power to reduce 104.99 Gt CO2 emissions (equivalent to 10.65% of total CO2 increase since 1750 AD). PV deployment's economic viability and emission reduction capacity demonstrate strong synergistic effects, with the maximum benefit gap being only 1.69% for the same priority area, compared to 14.55% for the environmental dimension. 

Compared to previous research, we additionally introduced economic benefits from photovoltaic power generation as a decision criterion, revealing significant differences in cost-effectiveness among different PV deployment strategies. Under conservative estimates of grid electricity prices, only 30.6% of land deployed with photovoltaics can truly enhance economic outcomes, with cumulative economic effects ranging from 5,317.2 USD/ha/year to -3,496.4 USD/ha/year. Even within economically prioritized solutions, nearly one-fifth of the highest priority areas fall into negative economic return regions, underscoring the critical importance of economic objectives in deployment decisions.

## 2.2 Environmental similarity of deploying PV on abandoned cropland
By embedding 15 socioeconomic and biophysical predictors of PV deployment (see Methods), we developed a two-stage machine learning model integrating unsupervised learning and artificial neural network method. Our dataset comprised 10,152 US historical PV farm samples and 64,982 predicted abandoned cropland samples. 
 
Fig.2 Two-stage Environmental suitability modeling contributors. (a), US PV farms and abandoned cropland sites aggregated in US Agricultural Districts (b). The pseudo-label generation is based on GMM estimation with stratified sampling at the 5th, 25th, and 60th percentiles. Correlation analysis between first-stage GMM-estimation and second-stage MLP model (c) and Top 8 environmental contributors (d). The low correlation demonstrates the nonlinear influence of environmental predictors on PV deployment and the ability of the hybrid machine learning model to generate incremental information. 

The first-stage GMM estimation revealed distributional concordance between abandoned cropland and historical PV sites, with 65.9% falling within the interquartile range. Considering misclassification costs and sampling bias, our second-stage model achieved an optimal balance between two types of errors: true positives (95.8%) and false positives (3.3%), with learning curves demonstrating robust generalization performance. Overall, the average probability was 0.37, with the skewed distribution further emphasizing the necessity of strategic PV deployment on abandoned cropland. Moreover, the hockey-stick rising trend of the modified F1 score (optimal value: 5.39) further demonstrates the identification accuracy for abandoned croplands with high suitability for PV deployment, which are primarily located in the flat terrain of the Rust Belt and along the East Coast. 
The SHAP interpretation within the test set revealed the average marginal contributions and directional effects of factors influencing PV deployment probability. Grid distance and land use cover exerted the strongest influence on PV deployment, with human settlements and croplands showing consistent positive contributions, while forest and savanna areas with higher carbon sequestration capacity exhibited negative effects. Areas with superior socioeconomic conditions, including proximity to human settlements, higher per capita GDP, and flatter terrain, were more conducive to PV deployment.
## 2.3 Spatial correlation of PV and NCS carbon mitigation potential
 

Applying statistical measurement theory, we generated probability distributions for forest, agriculture, and grassland land-use sectors across abandoned cropland pixels using 10×10 pixel planning units (see Methods), enabling calculation of expected carbon sinks under baseline conditions without policy intervention. Our research confirms that the opportunity loss of forest carbon sequestration from large-scale PV deployment on abandoned cropland is acceptable, with the 3.9 Gt weighted CO2 emission reduction from NLCS representing only 3.7% of theoretical values. This finding aligns with field experiment conclusions (ranging from 20× PV emission reduction efficiency in humid regions to 100× in arid regions). Although PV deployment achieves emission reduction efficiency one order of magnitude higher than NLCS, prioritizing PV deployment strategies based solely on emission reduction efficiency could potentially reduce NLCS carbon sequestration capacity by up to 49.15%, with this effect being particularly pronounced in the forestry sector (Fig. 3). Given that high-carbon NLCS regions often co-deliver ecosystem services, biodiversity benefits, and social co-benefits16, our findings reinforce concerns that energy infrastructure deployment can diminish future ecological potential, underscoring the need to enhance PV–NLCS synergies while minimizing negative externalities.

Analysis of NLCS probability distributions and carbon sink potential reveals that the forestry sector dominates land reuse trajectories on U.S. abandoned cropland, with average probability of 75.8% covering more than 60% areas, contributing 79.3% of baseline carbon sinks in the absence of PV deployment. These high-probability lands largely coincide with regional natural endowments, being concentrated in the eastern deciduous forest region and the southeastern pine forest belt; notably, eight of the ten highest-probability states are in these regions, with Texas (10.4%) and California (3.5%) as the only exceptions. 

In the agricultural sector, perennial crop areas—commonly used in climate mitigation strategies as bioenergy crops—can sustain long-term carbon capture, thereby offsetting soil organic carbon (SOC) losses from conventional tillage and unsustainable land management. However, their weighted cumulative contribution to NLCS carbon sinks remains the smallest (5.8%). For grassland systems, even restoring abandoned cropland to pre-abandonment ecosystem conditions yields relatively limited gains (13.9% of the weighted total carbon sink potential). As grassland and shrub vegetation possess weaker above-ground biomass carbon storage capacity compared with forests, SOC constitutes the dominant share of carbon storage in this sector. 

## 2.4 Cost-benefit analysis of PV deployment under future climate policies
 
Integrating policy scenarios from AR6 across various models, we assessed the expected net benefits of PV deployment over the 2020-2050 lifecycle with 3 tiers (each pixel encompassing 265 policy scenario pathways), defined as potential net cash flows from PV power generation minus weighted opportunity costs of NLCS (See Methods). Using average grid feed-in tariff as the conservative baseline, our findings reveal that deploying PV on merely 30.6% of priority areas can achieve the maximum economic expectation of 698 billion USD. However, without smart PV deployment, the resulting economic net loss could reach -459 billion USD, potentially offsetting the benefits of 65.2% of priority areas that could generate economic returns (left of green shadow area in Fig. 1). 

Under scenarios with no globally coordinated policy (P1), almost all abandoned cropland deployments in the US fail to generate positive expected returns. This situation is significantly ameliorated under Immediate (P2) or Delayed (P3) climate action scenarios. If the US follows Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) without any transfer of emission permits (P2a), 27.3% of PV sites could achieve positive expected returns on average. Particularly under more ambitious climate transition targets, this proportion increases to 69.7% (P3c) and nearly 100% (P3b) positive expected returns. Therefore, cost-effective PV deployment requires proactive climate policy transformation, primarily driven by the demand substitution gap for fossil fuels, which promotes higher grid electricity prices for PV integration and facilitates reductions in levelized cost of electricity. 

Therefore, setting climate targets is necessary for promoting cost-effective PV deployment. Our results show that under relatively ambitious climate targets (P3), PV deployment on US abandoned cropland can achieve maximum positive economic expectations equivalent to xxx USD. Under relatively conservative climate targets (P2), excluding pixels with negative expectations (xx%), maximum economic expectations of xxx USD can also be achieved. These high-return PV farms are primarily located along the US West Coast in California and in the arid climate regions of the central United States. Furthermore, following the principle of maximum returns, we also found that compared to the economic expectation changes brought by PV strategies, NLCS opportunity costs can only generate a marginal impact (represented by XX%), indicating the enormous economic potential of PV deployment.

## 2.5 Optimizing PV Deployment synergy and policy responses 

 
For optimizing Coupling Coordination Degree (CCD, methods), which objectively reflects the average level and development direction among the 3E objectives. The results demonstrate enhanced outcomes compared to single-objective optimal cumulative paths, with our optimization approach exhibiting excellent global robustness. Under the policy premise of maintaining positive marginal benefit levels for all objectives (gray line in Fig. 1), the CCD solution, at the cost of 30.1% reduction in maximum economic expectations, achieves 72.2% performance equivalent to optimal environmental suitability scores by deploying PV in 36.6% of priority pixels, while also achieving emission reduction capabilities comparable to optimal emission reduction pathways. These high-CCD regions exhibit gradient changes following geographical divisions, with latitude 36° to 41° serving as the boundary. We further propose a synergistic line for PV deployment, which encompasses 80% of abandoned cropland pixels in the continental US with CCD values above the 30th percentile.

Moreover, the decision weights introduced when considering Smart PV deployment reflect potential policy adjustment directions (Fig. 5), which facilitate the transformation of PV deployment into local government actions at different scales. Overall, in the short term, state and county governments seeking large-scale PV deployment on abandoned cropland need to proactively and substantially reduce the decision weight of economic factors, and reallocate policy resources to enhance the synergy between environmental and emission reduction objectives (average decision weight: 0.45), representing a 43.2% reduction compared to the equal-weight baseline. However, not all regions can achieve high CCD levels through policy adjustments. Particularly in the Rust Belt region and northwestern states such as Oregon and Washington, these areas exhibit inherent conflicts between economic objectives and environmental and emission reduction goals, remaining at low deployment priority levels (CCD < 0.5) even when considering policy direction adjustments, indicating the need for more cautious assessment of local PV strategy feasibility.

# 3 Discussion 
Research from Ref. 10 suggests that utilizing merely 1% of cropland for PV deployment could achieve energy transition prospects. Globally, beyond the United States, abandoned cropland shows a persistent growth trend, approximately 6.6% of total global cropland, which appears to indicate the climate potential of large-scale PV deployment on abandoned land. However, our research integrating 3EF dimensional objectives reveals that many theoretically suitable PV deployment sites do not meet economic expectations, primarily due to significant trade-offs between economic objectives and the feasibility of environmental and emission reduction goals.

To advance global climate and energy policy transformation, deploying key infrastructure such as PV and wind power on marginal lands has become an ongoing focus of climate research and policy. Recent large-scale applications of neural network models can more precisely capture nonlinear factors affecting PV deployment. However, PV deployment policies do not always rely on expert priors, and scarce negative labels exacerbate environmental uncertainty, requiring real environmental suitability to be fine-tuned according to specific policy needs. Although our two-stage hybrid model has not yet explicitly integrated spatial autocorrelation and temporal advances in PV installation technology, compared to the limited historical information provided by unsupervised learning models, our hybrid learning model can achieve high-suitability land monitoring while avoiding optimistic estimates of PV construction, and emphasizes that directly generalizing PV deployment to specific land objects requires careful consideration, which is particularly important for policy tasks constrained by funding, human resources, and materials.
Although our research reaffirms that human-driven climate solutions far exceed NLCS in greenhouse gas emission reduction, which aligns with the law of energy conservation and biological growth limitations, NLCS still provides critical ecosystem services, biodiversity, and meets human food demands. Therefore, energy infrastructure deployment and NLCS should be treated as complementary climate strategies, with broader ecological effects requiring further integration into policy frameworks to enhance comparability.

This study explicitly maps spatial decision priority. However, real-world policy formulation is simultaneously constrained by fiscal budgets, international trade, and market demands, which are important factors that subsequent research should consider. Our proposed CCD approach remains a short-term and proactive adaptive policy solution, namely, reducing conflicts between various objectives by adjusting policy resource allocation to environmental and emission reduction dimensions, achieving proxy optimization. However, more fundamental long-term strategies lie in reducing trade-offs between different policy objectives themselves, with adopting more ambitious climate transition targets and rapidly promoting cost reduction in PV deployment technology being more critical.

# Methods 
## Two-stage modeling of environmental similarity and PV deploying probability
We developed a two-stage machine learning framework integrating Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) estimation and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier to predict the probability surface of PV deployment on abandoned cropland. The modeling pipeline consisted of three modules: (i) feature engineering of geospatial and socioeconomic datasets, (ii) negative sample construction via GMM-based environmental similarity scores, and (iii) supervised training of a neural network classifier with positive-unlabeled learning adjustment. Feature engineering harmonized ESA-CCI land cover (1992–2022) with the FAO definition of cropland abandonment and integrated two complementary PV datasets from OpenStreetMap as ground truth proxy and a model-based global inventory. All labels and features were standardized to a 1/120° (~1 km at equator) grid resolution with a unified preprocessing pipeline, including one-hot encoding for categorical land cover features.

**Feature Engineering of abandoned cropland and PV farm.** According to the FAO definition, cropland abandonment refers to cropland that is no longer actively cultivated and has been converted to other ecosystem types without direct human intervention for at least 5 consecutive years. Following this definition, we standardized the moving window detection for reducing false detections due to crop rotations and temporal resolution limitations: 1) We aggregated the original 37 land cover classes into 9 major classes including 5 ecosystem types (forest, wetlands, grassland, arid ecosystem, and shrublands), 1 cropland class (including all six cropland subclasses), 2 non-vegetation areas (water bodies, bare areas, and permanent ice), and 1 human settlements area. 2) A 5-year moving window was used for cropland abandonment detection, with areas converted to human settlements and reclaimed cropland (pixels that were once detected as abandoned but reverted to cropland for 2 successive years) excluded from the analysis. 

As for PV farm labels, we combined two complementary data sources to strengthen the ground-truth foundation of our spatial modeling. One dataset was derived from OSM, where we applied a 400-meter neighborhood radius with the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to delineate PV installations. The other dataset was a global PV inventory generated by convolutional neural network models, which identified commercial-, industrial-, and utility-scale PV facilities.

Our model incorporated 15 features including physical geographic environment (land cover, digital elevation, slope, gross dry matter productivity), climatic factors (near-surface air temperature, wind speed, shortwave radiation), and socio-economic factors (population density, gridded and subnational level of GDP per capita17, distance to human settlements18 and power system19, and road density in tertiary, primary and secondary level20. A unified preprocessing pipeline was implemented for feature standardization, and categorical land cover data were further transformed through one-hot encoding to convert discrete types into numerical features suitable for model computation.

**First-stage of GMM unsupervised learning and negative sampling.** In the first stage, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) density estimation was employed to quantify the environmental similarity between abandoned cropland and historical PV sites based on their feature distributions. Compared with non-parametric kernel density estimation (KDE), which suffers from the curse of dimensionality, GMM provides a more robust estimation by decomposing the feature space into a finite number of Gaussian components (n). To identify the most influential feature components affecting PV siting, we performed five-fold cross-validation by maximizing the mean log-likelihood. To ensure numerical stability of the optimal hyperparameters and to prevent overfitting, we incorporated a diagonal covariance structure, multiple random initializations, and a regularization term into the model, thereby capturing heterogeneous PV siting environments. Using the logarithmic transformation of the PV distribution estimates as a reference, we constructed a customizable stratified negative sampling strategy by selecting low-similarity pixels from the prediction pool. In this study, we set the 5th percentile as the sampling threshold for highly heterogeneous features.

**Second-stage neural network training.** Unlike the GMM, which provided an environmental similarity score, we further trained a deep neural network classifier by combining positive PV sites with GMM-selected negative samples. The network architecture comprised three hidden layers (128, 64, and 32 neurons) with ReLU activations, batch normalization, and dropout regularization (0.3). To ensure robust evaluation, the dataset was split into training, validation, and testing subsets (60/20/20), and negative labels equivalent to 20% of the positive sample size were introduced.
Given that negative samples were sub-sampled from unlabeled abandoned land (20% ratio), we adopted a positive–unlabeled (PU) learning framework to mitigate sampling bias. Model performance was assessed in two steps: first, using conventional metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) on the held-out test set under a default 0.5 threshold; second, by simulating alternative thresholds and applying cost-sensitive evaluation, with a false positive to false negative penalty ratio of 2:1, to reflect the higher economic and environmental costs of misclassifying unsuitable sites. This aims to improve both robustness to high-dimensional sampling bias and relevance to real-world PV deployment trade-offs.

## Assessment of net carbon abatement expectations 
**Calculation of PV carbon mitigation potential.** The carbon emissions mitigated by PV power are calculated by substituting grid electricity, using the baseline emission factors of the national grid. PV power generation is determined by the PV power generation potential ($\mathrm{PV_{POT}}$) and the installed capacity ($\mathrm{PV_{Installed}}$). $\mathrm{PV_{POT}}$ reflects the actual performance of PV cells relative to their nominal capacity, primarily influenced by environmental conditions. Following previous studies[^21], $\mathrm{PV_{POT}}$ is calculated as:

$$\mathrm{PV_{POT}} = P_R \cdot \frac{I}{I_{STC}}$$
$$P_R = 1 + \gamma \cdot (T_{cell} - T_{STC})$$

where $I$ is the surface downwelling shortwave radiation, $I_{STC}$ is the standard test condition irradiance (1000 W m$^{-2}$), $T_{cell}$ is the PV cell temperature, $T_{STC}$ is the standard cell temperature (25°C), and $\gamma$ is the temperature coefficient (e.g., $-0.005$ °C$^{-1}$).
where I represents surface downwelling shortwave radiation and P_R is the performance correlation ratio determined by temperature. The standard state referred to in this paper includes the shortwave flux on the PV cell (I_STC: 1000 W m^(-2)), the temperature of PV panel (T_STC: 25 ℃) , the temperature coefficient (γ: -0.005 ℃^(-1)). T_Cell represent the temperature of PV cell and can be approximated as follows: 

$$T_{\text{cell}} = a_1 + a_2 T + a_3 I + a_4 W$$
where $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$ and $a_4$ were taken as $4.3 ℃$, 0.943 (unitless), $0.028 ℃ ( W m^{-2} ) ^{-1}$ and $-1.528 ℃ (m s^{-1})^{-1}$, respectively. 
Those parameters are proven to be independent on location and cell technology, and have been widely used for estimating PV performance. To convert PV electricity generation into mitigation benefits, we followed the Harimonize Approach to Greenhouse Gas Accounting in accordance with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This method reflects the carbon dioxide emission intensity of the marginal electricity grid displaced by renewable generation, typically approximated using the Combined Margin (CM). The CM for the grid is comprised of an Operating Margin (OM) and a Build Margin (BM). In principle, the OM consists of existing power plants that would be affected and have the highest variable operating cost. The BM represents the cohort of the future power plants whose construction could be affected by PV project, based on an average of future emission intensities of new electricity generation. 
〖PV〗_carbon=〖PV〗_POT⋅〖PV〗_Installed⋅EF_CM⋅η_sys⋅Y⋅CF
EF_CM=EF_OM⋅W_OM+EF_BM⋅W_BM
〖PV〗_Installed=A_panel⋅η_stc
where 〖EF〗_OM is the OM factor and 〖EF〗_BM is BM factor. η_sys is module rated power density which was set as 0.17 "kW" m^(-2). η_sys denotes as system-level energy conversion factor typically ranging from 0.7-0.9, and we took 0.8 in this study22. Y denotes the annual operating hours of PV default set to 8760 h, and CF is the conversion factor ~0.27 (molar mass C/ molar mass CO2). 
Calculation of LNCS carbon sink potential and net mitigation expectation
Generating probability map of LNCS. Abandoned cropland admits multiple post-abandonment conversion pathways, so the likelihood of implementing LNCS is inherently spatially heterogeneous across sites. To explicitly estimate the variation in opportunities under policy interventions, we introduced statistical expectation formulation and allocated LNCS probability for each site, grounded in measure theory and historical land-cover trajectories. First, for each abandoned site, we identified the land cover type with the highest frequency of occurrence during its duration and assigned it as the most preferred land-use state. Second, we aggregated pixels into larger regional units using 10 × 10 grids, and constructed density vectors for each unit according to the proportional counts of different land-use types, which aligned with canonical LNCS plants of woody plants, cultivated crops, and herbaceous vegetation. Third, K-d tree was constructed for searching proximate abandoned cropland, and inverse distance weighting (IDW) was applied to assign reuse probability across forest, agriculture, and grassland land sectors. 

$$E_i^{(s)}[C] = PV_{\text{carbon}} - \sum_{k \in \{F, A, N\}} p_{i,k}^{(s)} \cdot C_{i,k}^{(s)}$$

$$C_{i,k}(t) = \min \left( C_{i,k,0} + \sum_{\tau=1}^{t} \Delta C_{i,k,\tau},\; C_{i,k,\max} \right), \quad k \in \{F, A, N\}$$

**Estimation carbon sink potential across LNCS.** We integrated several globally high-resolution datasets of aboveground biomass (AGB), belowground biomass (BGB), and soil organic carbon (SOC) into expectation calculation framework for carbon storage. Considering the biological limitation of natural carbon sequestration, the net accumulation of carbon storage was assessed over a 30-year horizon, capped by the maximum potential carbon storage of Walker et al.23 under current biogeophysical conditions and the absence of human disturbance. For estimating growth across different carbon pools, we used the gridded annual carbon sequestration rates24 of natural forest regrowth as a multiplier for AGB, further combined with the root-mass fraction (RMF) map from Ma et al.25, the SOC potential maps under future scenarios from FAO26, and the dead wood and litter carbon indicator (DWCI) to fine-tune carbon storage across LNCS.

(1) Afforestation. The afforestation accounts for four major carbon pools. For each abandoned site, we estimated total biomass stocks growth using the natural forest AGB accumulation map combined with the RMF map to derive BGB. The potential SOC density in the upper 2 m of soil was defined as the historical stock under no land-use conversion, and the unrealized SOC potential was used to represent the incremental contribution of afforestation over the 30 years. The dead wood and litter pools represent undecomposed carbon leaving on the ground surface of forest areas. This pool was calculated as a fraction of AGB and the ratio was provided by Harris et al27.

(2) Agriculture. We selected the suitability data of perennial and annual crops from Global Agro-Ecological Zoning database (GAEZ-V4)28. Following the IPCC guidelines for land-use practices, we assumed that abandoned sites highly suitable for perennial woody crops could only accumulate aboveground biomass for a finite period or ultimately reach a steady state, due to periodic pruning, harvesting, and other removals. By contrast, abandoned sites assigned to annual crop were assumed to exhibit no net biomass accumulation, since yearly gains in biomass stocks are offset by harvest and mortality within the same year. Thereby the principal variation in carbon storage occurs in SOC as a function of agricultural management. Taking historical SOC as the baseline from Walker et al., we calculated net changes by applying the SOC density variation rates under FAO’s agricultural management with business as usual. 

(3) No-woody vegetation. We considered savanna, shrub, grassland, and other non-forest land types as the main targets for implementing non-woody restoration. Carbon pools of non-woody plants are characterized by extensive root systems, with biomass largely concentrated in BGB, which primarily drives carbon input to soils29. Accordingly, shrub- and grass-specific root-mass fractions (RMFs) were applied to estimate BGB, while unrealized SOC potential was included to capture changes in soil carbon stocks under this pathway. DWCI was treated consistently with other pathways. 

## Cost-benefit analysis across climate Policy scenarios

Upon the LNCS probability framework, we extended the analysis to incorporate cost-benefit of PV deployment and computed opportunity cost of LNCS. For PV economic benefit, the data on electricity generation revenues and costs were obtained from IPCC AR6 Scenarios Database30, which is recognized as an ‘ensemble of opportunity’ providing transparency, pluralism, scientific credibility, and policy relevance scheme. We selected 11 policy scenarios with 3 tiers (P1, P2, P3) from IPCC AR6 assessment to capture the mean trend of future economic feasibility of solar PV under diverse model assumptions and constraints31. The policy scenarios give insights into how societal choices may steer the system, and P1 tier represents no globally coordinated policy; P2 are globally coordinated climate policies with immediate action, P3 are globally coordinated climate policies with delayed. Additionally, P4 are cost-benefit scenarios; due to insufficient data, they were not analyzed separately but incorporated into the mean trend.

Each abandoned site considered for PV deployment encompassed 265 alternative pathways, and three major datasets including one-time investment costs, operating costs incurred over the PV life cycle, and the price of secondary energy were extracted at 10-year intervals from 2020 to 2050 to calculate the net present value (NPV). All prices were standardized to constant 2020 US dollars and a discount rate of 5% was applied. Although the profitability of individual solar farms can vary substantially, we adopted a unified but simplified set of assumptions combined with a relatively diversified range of pathways to capture the average profitability of PV under different climate policy scenarios32. 

As for the opportunity cost of LNCS, we quantified each NPV separately. For agricultural sector, the 



## Priority optimization for synergistic PV deployment 

**Optimizing PV deployment with coupling coordination degree.** Using weighted coupling coordination degree (CCD) as a proxy for measuring synergy effect, we performed a sequential least squares programming (SLSQP) algorithm to search for PV deployment priority schemes with greater policy feasibility across the 3E objective space. 
$$T=\sum_{i=1}^3w_iU_i ,\quad C=\left(\frac{\prod_{i=1}^{3}U_{i}}{\left(\frac{1}{3}\sum_{i=1}^{3}U_{i}\right)^{3}}\right)^{1/3}, \quad \mathrm{CCD}=\sqrt{C\cdot T}$$

$$\underset{\mathbf{w}}{\operatorname*{maximize}}\quad\sqrt{C_{i}(\mathbf{U}_{i})\cdot T_{i}(\mathbf{w}_{i},\mathbf{U}_{i})}$$

$$\text{subject to}\quad\sum_{i=1}^{3}w_{i}=1,\quad w_{i}\geq0$$

where the coupling degree $C$ captures the equilibrium among the subsystems, while the coordination degree $T$ reflects their integrated performance under different decision preferences $w_{i}$ and is initially defined as the arithmetic mean of the normalized objectives $U_{i}$. To verify the feasibility of our solution in achieving co-benefits, we computed the mean cumulative benefit by integrating the gain curve over the full quantile range [0,1]. 
$$\mathbb{E}[f(U)]=\int_0^1f(u)du,\quad U\sim\mathrm{Uniform}(0,1)$$
where $\mathbb{E}[f(U)]$ denotes the expected benefit under uniform deployment probability across the prioritized surface and $f(u)$ is the accumulative gain under the ranked PV priority deloyment (i.e. priotize CCD, environment suitablitiy, emission abatement and economic revenue), serving as a proxy for averge benefit yield. Higher values indicate stronger clustering of high-benefit areas in the upper quantiles, validating the effectiveness of the specific solution.

Methods: Coupling coordination degree optimization through constrained multi-objective programming
Constrained optimization framework for CCD maximization
We implemented a sequential least squares programming (SLSQP) algorithm to optimize the coupling coordination degree (CCD) across the three-dimensional objective space of environmental sustainability, emission reduction potential, and economic feasibility. This constrained optimization approach enables identification of optimal weight combinations that maximize synergistic outcomes while maintaining mathematical consistency and physical interpretability of the decision framework.
Mathematical formulation of the optimization problem
The CCD optimization problem was formulated as a constrained minimization problem:
$$\min_{\mathbf{w}} \quad -\text{CCD}(\mathbf{w})$$
subject to:
$$\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i = 1$$
$$0 \leq w_i \leq 1, \quad \forall i \in \{1,2,3\}$$
where $\mathbf{w} = [w_1, w_2, w_3]$ represents the weight vector for environmental, emission reduction, and economic objectives, respectively, and $\text{CCD}(\mathbf{w})$ is the coupling coordination degree calculated as the geometric mean of coupling degree and coordination degree.
SLSQP algorithm implementation and convergence criteria
The SLSQP algorithm was implemented using the scipy.optimize.minimize function with the following specifications: maximum iterations of 1000, tolerance for constraint violation of 1×10⁻⁶, and tolerance for parameter changes of 1×10⁻⁸. The algorithm employs a sequential quadratic programming approach that iteratively solves quadratic subproblems to find the optimal weight combination while satisfying the equality and inequality constraints.
Objective function design and gradient computation
The objective function was designed to maximize the negative CCD score, ensuring compatibility with the minimization framework. The algorithm computes gradients numerically using finite difference approximations, enabling efficient convergence to the optimal solution. The CCD calculation incorporates both the coupling degree, which measures the strength of interaction between objectives, and the coordination degree, which quantifies the harmonious development among the three dimensions.
Constraint handling and feasibility maintenance
The optimization framework incorporates two types of constraints: (1) an equality constraint ensuring that the sum of all weights equals unity, maintaining the probabilistic interpretation of the weight vector, and (2) boundary constraints restricting each weight to the interval [0,1], preventing negative weights and ensuring physical interpretability. The SLSQP algorithm maintains constraint feasibility throughout the optimization process through active set methods and penalty function approaches.
Initialization strategy and convergence analysis
The optimization process was initialized from an equal-weight baseline ($w_i = 1/3$ for all objectives), providing a neutral starting point for weight adjustment. Convergence was assessed through multiple criteria: (1) the relative change in objective function value between consecutive iterations, (2) the satisfaction of constraint conditions, and (3) the stability of the optimal weight vector across multiple optimization runs with different initial conditions.
Robustness validation and sensitivity analysis
The robustness of the optimization results was validated through Monte Carlo simulations with perturbed initial conditions and cross-validation across different spatial aggregation levels. Sensitivity analysis was conducted by systematically varying constraint parameters and analyzing the impact on optimal weight combinations. Results demonstrated excellent numerical stability, with the algorithm consistently converging to similar optimal solutions under diverse initialization conditions.
Performance evaluation and policy interpretation
The optimization algorithm achieved significant improvements in overall coordination, with the optimal weight combination yielding a 6.6 ± 1.2% enhancement in CCD compared to the equal-weight baseline. The optimal solution reduced economic decision weight by 43.2% while maintaining economic feasibility, demonstrating the algorithm's ability to identify non-intuitive but mathematically optimal weight distributions that enhance overall system performance.
This constrained optimization framework provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for multi-objective decision-making in photovoltaic deployment, enabling identification of optimal strategies that balance competing sustainability objectives while maximizing overall coordination. The SLSQP algorithm's robust convergence properties and effective constraint handling make it particularly suitable for this class of optimization problems, where both mathematical rigor and practical interpretability are essential for policy applications.


Methods: Coupling coordination degree optimization
Constrained optimization framework for CCD maximization
We implemented a sequential least squares programming (SLSQP) algorithm to optimize the coupling coordination degree (CCD) across the three-dimensional objective space. The CCD was calculated as:
$$\text{CCD} = \sqrt{C \times D}$$
where the coupling degree $C$ measures the strength of interaction between objectives:
$$C = \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{3} \sum_{j=i+1}^{3} |w_i - w_j|}{\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i}$$
and the coordination degree $D$ quantifies harmonious development:
$$D = 1 - \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{3} (w_i - \bar{w})^2}{3 \cdot \bar{w}^2}}$$
where $\bar{w} = \frac{1}{3}\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i$ and $w_i$ represents the decision weights for each dimension.
Data dimensions and weight optimization
The three dimensions were characterized by distinct data types: environmental sustainability scores ($E_i$) derived from machine learning predictions, emission reduction potential ($M_i$) calculated from carbon sequestration models, and economic feasibility indicators ($F_i$) based on net present value analysis. The optimization problem was formulated as:
$$\arg\min_{\mathbf{w}} \quad -\text{CCD}(\mathbf{w})$$
subject to the constraint $\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i = 1$ and bounds $0 \leq w_i \leq 1$, where $w_1$, $w_2$, and $w_3$ represent the decision weights for environmental, emission reduction, and economic dimensions, respectively.
Algorithm implementation and convergence
The SLSQP algorithm was implemented using scipy.optimize.minimize with maximum iterations of 1000 and constraint tolerance of 1×10⁻⁶, initialized from an equal-weight baseline ($w_i = 1/3$). The algorithm demonstrated excellent numerical stability, consistently converging to solutions that achieved a 6.6 ± 1.2% enhancement in CCD compared to the baseline, with optimal weights reducing economic decision weight by 43.2% while maintaining economic feasibility. This constrained optimization framework provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for identifying optimal deployment strategies that balance competing sustainability objectives while maximizing overall coordination across the three-dimensional space.
