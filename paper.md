Smart-Photovoltaic Deployment on Abandoned Cropland for Accelerating Climate Goals in the United States 

Abstract: The rapid expansion of photovoltaic (PV) farms has intensified cross-sector spatial competition, creating climate decision uncertainties. Reallocating marginal land offers a low-cost and feasible policy solution. Here, we conducted a spatially explicit assessment of cross-sector carbon mitigation potential and developed an integrated environment-emission-economic feasibility (3EF) decision optimization framework for PV deployment on abandoned cropland. Our findings reveal that deploying photovoltaics on 4.38 Mha of abandoned cropland in the United States (0.5% of total US land area) could achieve 104.99 Gt CO2 substitution emission reductions, equivalent to 21.02% of global carbon neutrality targets by 2050. Without policy intervention, the circular of US abandoned cropland is predominantly driven by the forestry sector (平均概率75.78%±0.19%), while the net mitigation benefits of energy sector PV deployment are 27.08 times greater than traditional land-based mitigation strategies when weighted. Additionally, despite 69.41% of abandoned cropland PV deployment showing negative economic benefit over the 2020-2050 lifecycle under future policy scenarios, economic factors (average weight 0.19) should be minimized in climate mitigation policies to achieve 3EF synergy (environment 0.48, emission 0.33). Promisingly, global carbon emission would be largely offset if even less deploying photovoltaics on abandoned cropland for grid substitution by 2050, offering a transformative pathway for clean energy transitions.





1 Introduction

To cap cumulative carbon emissions at approximately 335 PgC from 2023 onward and meet global climate targets, the large scale deployment of low carbon photovoltaic (PV) systems is indispensable1,2. By 2050, solar PV will become the world’s leading electricity source with 8,519 GW of installed capacity, meeting 25% of total demand3,4. As the leading force in global energy industry, the United States (US) remains the largest historical carbon emitter, now pursues an ambitious transition by expanding its solar share to roughly 30 % by mid century5. However, the rapid rollout of PV in rural communities threatens productive cropland and impose adverse environmental impacts6. This tension has spurred growing interest in natural and land-based climate solutions, like allocating PV or afforestation on marginal lands, including open-pit mining sites7, and urban-rural settlements8. Despite numerous promising climate solutions, the real feasibility of large-scale PV deployment at the national scale remains largely unknown, thereby clouding policymakers' confidence in advancing energy transitions. To fill this gap, we quantify both the land-based PV deployment potential from 2020-2050 and highlight potential decision-making trade-offs, including environmental suitability, carbon abatement ability, and economic feasibility.
Solar energy is essential for climate mitigation; however, unlike nuclear, bioenergy, or geothermal energy, the power output of PV is highly sensitive to climatic conditions9. Recent research shows strong compatibility between cropland and PV deployment10, as farming activities already exist in regions with favorable solar radiation temperature, and wind conditions. While US croplands expand over 0.4 million hectares annually11, substantial abandonment also occurs in areas like the Mid-Atlantic Coast, aligning with the accelerating abandonment trends observed across the Global North12. Like agrivoltaics co-location and perovskite PV approaches, redeveloping abandoned cropland for PV installation represents a promising emissions reduction pathway that could provide unique spatial opportunities. However, large-scale PV deployment requires local energy infrastructure and socio-economic support, which vary significantly across regions. Previous research has inadequately captured these national-specific spatiotemporal heterogeneities. Recent advances in machine learning and high-dimensional statistical data embedding offer opportunities to extract multi-dimensional characteristics from historical PV installation data and generalize these insights to specific policy target regions.
Although Natural Climate Solutions (NLCS) are widely recognized as the most cost-effective approach13, ecosystems require decades for long-term carbon sequestration and have high land demand. Field experiments from the United States14, Israel15 etc., have demonstrated that despite PV deployment leading to a significantly decrease in surface albedo and consequently increase local temperature, the atmospheric carbon mitigation efficiency is ~50× than afforestation. Furthermore, as the US levelized cost of PV electricity generation continues to decline to $0.03 by 2030, large-scale PV deployment will become increasingly economically viable. However, current assessments of solar deployment potential remain limited in scope, primarily focusing on electricity generation potential while neglecting the broader socio-economic and policy implications. The absence of comprehensive cross-sectoral comparative evaluations (e.g., agriculture, forestry, grass) may significantly underestimate the policy potential of large-scale PV deployment and create uncertainty for policymakers in advancing energy transitions.
Here, we propose an extensible decision-making framework for land-based climate policy. First, we identify the spatiotemporal distribution of abandoned cropland and existing solar farm locations across US using time-series land-use imagery and OpenStreetMap (OSM) geographic data. Subsequently, we train an environmentally-similarity-based machine learning model that integrates multi-source spatiotemporal data including climatic, geographic-physical, and socio-economic factors to assess land suitability for PV deployment. Second, we estimate the probability distribution of cropland redevelopment strategies based on statistical measurement principles, calculate the net emissions reduction expectations of Natural Climate Solutions (NCS), and further validate the emissions reduction potential of photovoltaics. Third, utilizing multiple policy scenarios from the AR6 assessment, we estimate the net cash flows and cumulative cost changes of PV deployment compared to other emissions reduction strategies under different future climate policy scenarios from 2020 to 2050. Finally, we integrate these three dimensions to generate a PV deployment priority decision map (Fig.1), which could serve as a decision-making tool for US and other countries.

Over the 28-year period following 1992, the continental US accumulated 4.38 Mha of stable abandoned cropland, maintaining an annual growth rate of 19.89%, which aligns with the cropland abandonment patterns observed across Global North countries. This substantial land base undoubtedly provides significant marginal space for large-scale photovoltaic deployment. Consistent with earlier findings, these abandoned croplands are primarily concentrated in Texas, Illinois, and California, with the most rapid growth occurring in the Mid-Atlantic, Gulf Coast, and Pacific Northwest regions. Our PV deployment priorities provide a multi-objective policy pathway for supporting adaptive climate policy (Fig. 1), emphasizing the necessity of precision deployment over homogeneous deployment strategies. The outcomes of PV deployment on US abandoned cropland reveal considerable trade-offs and spatial heterogeneity, particularly when focusing exclusively on environmental sustainability, carbon mitigation potential, or economic revenue (see Methods). 
First, high environmental suitability scores indicate greater similarity between historical PV construction environments and abandoned cropland, with local infrastructure and geographic-climatic conditions better suited to the technical requirements of photovoltaic installation. However, PV deployment strategies based solely on environmental suitability objectives face substantial long-term economic losses for the same deployed area (with the maximum benefit gap occurring at the 45.5th percentile of priority areas, equivalent to requiring an additional 2.13-fold cost recovery). Therefore, even for pre-cultivated land with extremely high consistency with cropland conditions, large-scale PV deployment still requires consideration of real-world feasibility, particularly the economic dimension. 
Regarding carbon mitigation benefits, under theoretical conditions from 2020-2050, converting all abandoned cropland generated in the United States from 1992-2020 to photovoltaics could cumulatively substitute grid power to reduce 104.99 Gt CO2 emissions (equivalent to 10.65% of total CO2 increase since 1750 AD). PV deployment's economic viability and emission reduction capacity demonstrate strong synergistic effects, with the maximum benefit gap being only 1.69% for the same priority area, compared to 14.55% for the environmental dimension. 
Compared to previous research, we additionally introduced economic benefits from photovoltaic power generation as a decision criterion, revealing significant differences in cost-effectiveness among different PV deployment strategies. Under conservative estimates of grid electricity prices, only 30.6% of land deployed with photovoltaics can truly enhance economic outcomes, with cumulative economic effects ranging from 5,317.2 USD/ha/year to -3,496.4 USD/ha/year. Even within economically prioritized solutions, nearly one-fifth of the highest priority areas fall into negative economic return regions, underscoring the critical importance of economic objectives in deployment decisions.
2.2 Environmental suitability of deploying PV on abandoned cropland
Deploying photovoltaic systems on abandoned croplands represents an emerging policy demand for specific spatial environments. However, prior spatial patterns inadequately predict deployment suitability in specific regions under specific policy orientations, due to sparse effective training sets and the absence of negative sample information. By embedding 15 socioeconomic and biophysical predictors of PV deployment (see Methods), we developed a two-stage machine learning model integrating unsupervised learning Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) method. Our dataset comprised 10,152 US historical PV farm samples and 64,982 predicted abandoned cropland samples. In the first stage, GMM density estimation was employed to quantify the environmental similarity between abandoned cropland and historical PV sites. Using percentile transformation and stratified sampling, we built negative sample pool from low-similarity pixels (particularly those below the 5th percentile, representing approximately 5.8% of total abandoned cropland or 0.38 Mha) and trained a neural network classifier to generate probability surfaces of PV deployment for detailed policy supporting.
The first-stage GMM estimation revealed distributional concordance between abandoned cropland and historical PV sites, with 65.9% falling within the interquartile range. Considering misclassification costs and sampling bias, our second-stage model achieved an optimal balance between two types of errors: true positives (95.8%) and false positives (3.3%), with learning curves demonstrating robust generalization performance. Overall, the average probability was 0.37, with the skewed distribution further emphasizing the necessity of strategic PV deployment on abandoned cropland. Moreover, the hockey-stick rising trend of the modified F1 score (optimal value: 5.39) further demonstrates the identification accuracy for abandoned croplands with high suitability for PV deployment, which are primarily located in the flat terrain of the Rust Belt and along the East Coast. 
The SHAP interpretation within the test set revealed the average marginal contributions and directional effects of factors influencing PV deployment probability. Grid distance and land use cover exerted the strongest influence on PV deployment, with human settlements and croplands showing consistent positive contributions, while forest and savanna areas with higher carbon sequestration capacity exhibited negative effects. Areas with superior socioeconomic conditions, including proximity to human settlements, higher per capita GDP, and flatter terrain, were more conducive to PV deployment.

2.3 PV deployment outperforms NLCS in mitigation potential
Applying statistical measurement theory, we generated probability distributions for forest, agriculture, and grassland land-use sectors across abandoned cropland pixels using 10×10 pixel planning units (see Methods), enabling calculation of expected carbon sinks under baseline conditions without policy intervention. Our research confirms that the opportunity loss of forest carbon sequestration from large-scale PV deployment on abandoned cropland is acceptable, with the 3.9 Gt weighted CO2 emission reduction from NLCS representing only 3.7% of theoretical values. This finding aligns with field experiment conclusions (ranging from 20× PV emission reduction efficiency in humid regions to 100× in arid regions). Although PV deployment achieves emission reduction efficiency one order of magnitude higher than NLCS, prioritizing PV deployment strategies based solely on emission reduction efficiency could potentially reduce NLCS carbon sequestration capacity by up to 49.15%, with this effect being particularly pronounced in the forestry sector (Fig. 2). Given that high-carbon NLCS regions often co-deliver ecosystem services, biodiversity benefits, and social co-benefits16, our findings reinforce concerns that energy infrastructure deployment can diminish future ecological potential, underscoring the need to enhance PV–NLCS synergies while minimizing negative externalities.
Analysis of NLCS probability distributions and carbon sink potential reveals that the forestry sector dominates land reuse trajectories on U.S. abandoned cropland, with average probability of 75.8% (standard error ±0.2%) of 60.1% (standard error ±0.4%) areas, contributing an estimated 79.3% of baseline carbon sinks in the absence of PV deployment. These high-probability lands largely coincide with regional natural endowments, being concentrated in the eastern deciduous forest region and the southeastern pine forest belt; notably, eight of the ten highest-probability states are in these regions, with Texas (10.4%) and California (3.5%) as the only exceptions. 
In the agricultural sector, perennial crop areas—commonly used in climate mitigation strategies as bioenergy crops—can sustain long-term carbon capture, thereby offsetting soil organic carbon (SOC) losses from conventional tillage and unsustainable land management. However, their weighted cumulative contribution to NLCS carbon sinks remains the smallest (5.8%). For grassland systems, even restoring abandoned cropland to pre-abandonment ecosystem conditions yields relatively limited gains (13.9% of the weighted total carbon sink potential). As grassland and shrub vegetation possess weaker above-ground biomass carbon storage capacity compared with forests, SOC constitutes the dominant share of carbon storage in this sector.

2.3 Cost-benefit analysis under future climate policies
Integrating policy scenarios from AR6 across various models, we assessed the expected net benefits of PV deployment over the 2020-2050 lifecycle with 4 tiers (each pixel encompassing 265 policy scenario pathways), defined as potential net cash flows from PV power generation minus weighted opportunity costs of NLCS (See Methods). Based on our conservative estimates using grid electricity prices as the baseline, our findings reveal that under scenarios with no globally coordinated policy (P1), almost all abandoned cropland deployments in the US fail to generate positive expected returns. This situation is significantly ameliorated under Immediate (P2) or Delayed (P3) climate action scenarios. If the US follows Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) without any transfer of emission permits (P2a), 27.3% of PV sites could achieve positive expected returns on average. Particularly under more ambitious climate transition targets, this proportion increases to 69.7% (P3c) and nearly 100% (P3b) positive expected returns. Therefore, cost-effective PV deployment requires proactive climate policy transformation, primarily driven by the demand substitution gap for fossil fuels, which promotes higher grid electricity prices for PV integration and facilitates reductions in levelized cost of electricity.

Environmental similarities between deployed PV farms and abandoned cropland
Mapping of Abandoned Cropland and PV Farm. In this article, we focus on the abandoned cropland in US for PV deployment decision-making. This choice is based on the fact that abandoned cropland, as pre-cultivated areas, represents natural ideal sites for large-scale PV deployment. Furthermore, the widespread abandonment of cropland across the Global North has attracted increasing attention from land managers. According to the FAO definition, cropland abandonment refers to cropland that is no longer actively cultivated and has been converted to other ecosystem types without direct human intervention for at least 5 consecutive years. Following this definition, we performed moving window detection on the ESA-CCI land cover maps from 1992-2022, which are spatiotemporally harmonized and widely used for long-term land change monitoring. For further reducing false detections due to crop rotations and temporal resolution limitations that introduce uncertainty in abandonment detection, we standardized the detection algorithm operations: 1) We aggregated the original 37 land cover classes into 9 major classes into 1km × 1km, including 5 ecosystem types (forest, wetlands, grassland, arid ecosystem, and shrublands), 1 cropland class (including all six cropland subclasses), 2 non-vegetation areas (water bodies, bare areas, and permanent ice), and 1 human settlements area. 2) A 5-year moving window was used for cropland abandonment detection, with areas converted to human settlements and reclaimed cropland (pixels that were once detected as abandoned but reverted to cropland for 2 successive years) excluded from the analysis. 3) Each abandoned cropland pixel was labeled with the abandonment start year, duration period, reclamation status, and abandonment status in the target year for auxiliary analysis and validation.

Current time-series datasets for large-scale PV deployment remain scarce, making it difficult to identify spatiotemporal variations in environmental preferences for PV construction. Building upon the work of Dunnett et al., we further extended the PV dataset to include time-series information, enabling policymakers to access customized data for policy-relevant regions and time periods globally. This study utilizes the OpenStreetMap (OSM) online access interface to obtain point and polygon data for solar farms in the United States for 2015 and 2020, applying a recommended 400-meter neighborhood radius for the density-based spatial clustering with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm. This approach was chosen because we focus on high-level solar farm clusters, and within the 300-500 meter search radius, the gradient decline in unclustered PV vector counts is most rapid.

Modeling environmental similarity on abandoned cropland. This step involves a series of socio-economic and physical environmental predictors to more precisely generate probability surfaces for the likely development of renewable infrastructure. Ongoing research in advanced machine learning for capturing high-dimensional PV deployment features has primarily focused on learning positive sample characteristics while neglecting the environmental features of strong negative samples. However, in real-world PV deployment scenarios, many factors act as absolute constraints (such as water bodies, glaciers, nature reserves, disaster-prone areas, and densely populated urban residential areas), which may reduce model generalization capabilities. Therefore, we developed a two-stage machine learning model based on environmental similarity. The model incorporates features including physical geographic environment (land cover, DEM, slope, gross dry matter productivity), climatic factors (near-surface air temperature, wind speed, shortwave radiation), and socio-economic factors (population density, distance to human settlements, road density, GDP per capita). First, we fit a GMM model to the environmental features of historical PV farms to obtain their underlying density distribution. Then, we compute the density of each candidate abandoned cropland under this KDE model as an environmental-similarity score, and select the bottom 5–10% of locations as strong negative samples. Second, after completing the positive-negative sample assembly, we employed deep learning modeling to capture multi-level, high-order, and complex interactions among different features, while also addressing the spatial sparsity issue of different features in abandoned cropland. This approach outputs and predicts the probability of PV deployment for candidate abandoned cropland sites.

Net Carbon Abatement Expectation

Assessing PV carbon mitigation potential. The carbon emissions mitigated by PV power were calculated by replacing grid power using the baseline emission factors of the national grid. PV power generation is determined by PV power generation potential ($PV_{POT}$) and the installed capacity. The $PV_{POT}$, which describes the performance of PV cells constrast to the nominal power capacity, depends on primarily on actual environmental conditions. Following previous studies17, $PV_{POT}$ can be calculated as follows:

$$PV_{POT}=P_{R}\cdot\frac{I}{I_{STC}}$$
$$P_{R}=1+γ\cdot(T_{cell} - T_{STC})$$

where $I$ represents surface downwelling shortwave radiation and $P_{R}$ is the performance correlation ratio determined by temperature. The standard state referred to in this paper includes the shortwave flux on the PV cell ($I_{STC}: 1000 W m^{-2}$), the temperature of PV panel ($T_{STC}: 25 ℃$) , the temperature coefficient ($γ:-0.005 ℃^{-1}$). $T_{Cell}$ represent the temperature of PV cell and can be approximated as follows: 
$$T_{cell}=a_{1}+a_{2}\cdot T+a_{3}\cdot I+a_{4}\cdot W$$

where $a_{1},a_{2},a_{3}$ and $a_{4}$ are taken as 4.3 ℃, 0.943 , 0.028 $℃ (W m^{-2})^{-1}$ and $-1.528 ℃(m s^{-1})^{-1}$, respectively. Those parameters are proven to be independent on location and cell technology, and have been widely used for estimating PV performance. To convert PV electricity generation into mitigation benefits, we followed the Harimonize Approach to Greenhouse Gas Accounting in accordance with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This method reflects the emission intensity of the marginal electricity grid displaced by renewable generation, typically approximated using the Combined Margin (CM). The CM for the grid is comprised of an Operating Margin (OM) and a Build Margin (BM). In principle, the OM consists of existing power plants that would be affected and have the highest variable operating cost. The BM represents the cohort of the future power plants whose construction could be affected by PV project, based on an average of future emission intensities of new electricity generation. 

$$P_{carbon}=P_{POT} \cdot  P_{Installed}\cdot EF_{CM}$$
$$EF_{CM}= EF_{OM} \cdot W_{OM}+ EF_{BM}\cdot W_{BM}$$

where $EF_{OM}$ is the OM factor and $EF_{BM}$ is BM factor. 

Allocating reuse probability based on spatial-temporal joint distribution. Research from Crawford reveals the conversion instability of abandoned cropland, with an average duration of only 14.22 years. This means that during our 30-year study period, more than half of the abandoned cropland may revert to cultivated land. Additionally, for the original land use trajectories of abandoned cropland, there are different conversion pathways such as forest restoration and non-woody vegetation recovery. This study combines existing research on the empirical function of cropland reclamation time and historical spatial change trajectories of abandoned cropland to construct a spatiotemporal joint distribution model for abandoned cropland redevelopment strategies. Specifically, on the one hand, in the spatial dimension, we identified the land type with the highest frequency of occurrence for each abandoned cropland pixel during its duration based on measure theory. Following 10×10 comprehensive planning units, we generated density variables based on the proportion of different land use types, and used inverse distance weighting to generate probabilities for reclamation, forest restoration, and vegetation recovery strategies. On the other hand, in the temporal dimension, we established a model based on existing research on the remaining reclamation proportion over time t, following the formula below.
